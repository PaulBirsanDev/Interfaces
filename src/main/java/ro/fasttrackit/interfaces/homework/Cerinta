1) A company wants to advertise its services. The advertisement may be on facebook, e-mail, print.
Build the objects and interface

2) A person needs a banking account. There are several banks that provide this service: ING, BT, BRD.
The bank needs to provide the possibility to withdraw and deposit money.

3) Create an interface that describes how an Animal behaves: walk(), talk(), eat().
Provide implementations: Cat, Dog, Mouse, Chicken, Duck. The implementations will just return a string

eg. class Cat{ public String walk(){
return "cat-walking";
}}

4)Create an object that represents a Student with name and grade.
Add getters for them. No setters, the object is immutable.
Create two static fields that will remember the sum of the grades and the other is the number of students.
Also create a static method that uses these static fields to calculate the average grade for all students
